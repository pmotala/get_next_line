# get_next_line - @WeThinkCode_
get_next_line is a simple C function, that is used to read from a valid file. It will read line by line.

### What is FDF?
[get_next_line][1] is an individual project at [WeThinkCode_][2] that requires us to programme function, that uses some of the functions found in the [Libft][3] library to read lines from a `VALID FILE`. It reads a single file, but when run in a loop, it will read all the files lines, until it reaches the end. 

### What is in the Project?

Take a look in the [Project instructions][1]. The project has 2 sections:

1.  **Main Programme:** A basic programme that can read a single line from a single file (or single file descriptor).
2.  **Bonus Additions:** giving the function the ability to read from multiple file descriptors (multiple files basically).

### The Mechanics behind it all?

The goal is to create a function called get_next_line.

To use that function, after downloading/cloning this project, **cd** into the project:

	git clone https://github.com/pmotala/get_next_line
	cd get_next_line

You should see a *get_next_line.c* file and some other files (.h), as well as the libft library.

Enjoy.
